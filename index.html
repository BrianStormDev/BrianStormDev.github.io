      <h1>Being an Ethical Engineer/Student</h1>
    </header>
     <p><strong>Written by Brian Leong</strong></p>

<p>
    If you haven't heard this yet, welcome to UC Berkeley! CS61A is one of the first 
courses that students take when entering the field of Computer Science. But whether you plan on pursuing 
Computer Science as a career or are simply interested in Computer Science, we want to inform you 
of some important ethical considerations you should take. Note that while this is framed from the 
perspective of preparing oncoming engineers and computer scientists, you may still find this 
relevant for your future prospects. 
</p>

<p>This list is not complete and is subject to change and be updated.
If you find there are additions to be made, feel free to email cs61a@berkeley.edu
or myself at bleong314@berkeley.edu!
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why are We Mentioning This?</h2>
<p>
    Whether it be during your time here in CS61A or some time later in life, we recognize
    that you will be presented with many opportunities to contribute to emerging technologies.
    Considering that we are an introductory class, we want to introduce you to the reality that
    you will be facing decisions that impact people. While it might be easy to think that you
    are just typing lines on a computer, many programs have the power to change the world for the better
    or for the worse. Additionally, how you treat others in this course will also shape how you are perceived
    by others both now and in the future.
</p>

<p>
    At UC Berkeley, we emphasize the 
    <a href = https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code> Honor Code</a>
    because we believe that every student should treat others with kindness and respect. 
    While you may be convinced that you only have to uphold such codes while you are here 
    at UC Berkeley, the truth is that these ethical principles apply in the workforce and in 
    any sort of occupation that you might be preparing for in the future. 
</p>

<p>
    Your time here at UC Berkeley is very similar to what you'll experience in the workplace.
    You'll be faced with deadlines, pressure to perform, and will be working with others. You
    may be tempted on many occasions to take shortcuts, but we encourage you to avoid cheating. 
    By cheating, you both undermine the efforts of other students, and hinder your own learning.
    When you are in the workforce, you will be solving problems that no one has ever solved before!
    So while you are here, you should prepare yourself by upholding academic honesty. 
    By working on your ethical habits during your time here in CS61A, you'll be more than prepared for when
    you enter the workforce. But more importantly, you'll work towards becoming a better person.
</p>

<h2 id="defining">Being Ethical Regarding your Own Work</h2>
<p>
  Here we mention some ethical considerations regarding your own work:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Academic Integrity: As a student as UC Berkeley, we want to prepare you to be your best
    when you join the workforce. An important part of that preparation comes with academic integrity.
    Part of the reason why we enforce academic integrity is because we want to ensure you get the most out of
    the class. That means that behavior such as copying other students' code or asking an online forum
    for answers is unacceptable, and is subject to academic penalties. If you ever find yourself tempted to cheat,
    remind yourself that you risk not only those penalities, but are undermining your own development
    in Computer Science!
  </li>
  <li>
    The Use of Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence has become more and more prevalent
    in both industry and student workflows. While it can be used to support your learning, it should 
    not be used as a replacement. What makes a good and ethical Computer Scientist is one who can solve
    problems on their own without simply pasting AI content for credit. After all, the people who are 
    hiring are not looking for a prompt engineer, but rather someone who can solve problems!
  </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="defining">Being Ethical When Working with Others</h2>
<p>
  Here we provide a few gudelines on how be ethical when working on a team:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
  Never Condescend: The staff here at CS61A strongly believe that everyone is capable of learning.
  People often excel in different areas, after all, that is why people major in different
  subjects at college! But often you don't get to experience that gap until you work in a group or partner setting.
  In this class, you will often have to work in a group, and it may be tempting to talk poorly about others
  who are not doing as well on a subject or do not seem as focused as you are. However, it's important to recognize
  that condescending doesn't benefit anyone. The next time you are tempted to talk poorly about someone, try 
  framing it as constructive criticism, rather than an attack on one's character.
</li>
<li>
  Share the Credit: Related to the previous point, take time to recognize the people who are working with you 
  and what they are contributing. Often we only consider our own contributions rather than the contributions
  of others. Even if it feels like you are the one who is doing all of the coding (which shouldn't be the case
  if you are doing pair programming on course projects!), know that everyone learns at a different pace. So 
  even if your partner or group may not be meeting your expectations, try to recognize when they are working hard. 
<li>
  Respect the Staff: You'll find that in many workplaces, you will often have superiors who are in charge of managing
  you and your coworkers. Sometimes, you may not get along with your superiors, but that doesn't mean that you 
  should insult or ignore them. Often there are a lot of things happening in the life of course staff members 
  and by not treating them with respect, you discourage them from further contributing to Computer Science education.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="defining">Being Ethical With What You Work On</h2>
<p>
  Here we provide a few guidelines on how be ethical when deciding who to work for or what to work on.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
  Ensure you align with Employer Values: As a student as UC Berkeley, you will presented with many opportunities for places
  to work, whether that be research or a job. However, one must recognize how a role's ethics lines up with their own. 
  Sometimes it's easy to let big salary numbers entice individuals to take jobs, however, make sure to do your research
  on who you are working for.
</li>
<li>
  Always Test Your Code: Engineering is an ongoing process, and it’s critical to adopt the habit of consistently testing your work. 
  In courses like CS61B, where tests are not predefined for you, you'll encounter a similar challenge in the real world. 
  It’s your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and safety of your code, as it can have serious implications for others' lives.
  An example of this is the case of 
  <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25> Therac-25:</a>
  A machine that was programmed to give radiation therapy to patients in need. However, due to a number of 
  failures in programming the needed safety mechanisms, the machine ended up overdosing patients with 
  radiation on multiple occasions, resulting in their deaths. 
  It's important to keep this emphasis in mind early on in your career, as it may prevent critical accidents
  from occurring. 
</ol>

<h2 id="reporting-an-incident">Speaking Up / Reporting an Incident</h2>

<p>We recognize that disputes and conflicts can occur between students, staff,
instructors, etc. There are many different types of incidents, including but not
limited to discrimination, assault, conflict, etc... Nevertheless, we want to 
encourage you to speak up if you notice anything suspicious. Thus, we provide many resources where you can anonymously
report any negative experiences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The EECS department provides
  <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances#eecs-climate">many ways</a>
  to report issues within the department, including general incidents,
  grievances with faculty, sexual harassment, and discrimination. Please report
  any incidents to us or to the department using the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4NYHdUJ8IzYA1SoiTinWBybGWkj0mfmdnHAeygAxkZajelQ/viewform">department form</a>,
  so that we can continue to improve the CS student experience.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://advocate.berkeley.edu">Student Advocate’s Office</a> (SAO) "is a
  student-run organization that helps students litigate issues with professors."</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/Ombuds">Ombudsperson for Students</a> "can be your
  first step, your last resort, or anything in between. The Ombudsperson will
  listen to your concerns, serve as a sounding board, discuss your options with
  you, and help you get a new perspective and determine the next steps to take."</li>
  <li>Lastly, <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/report-incident">many resources</a> of
  support and ways to report issues are provided by the university as well.</li>
</ul>
